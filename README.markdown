Project Information:
This project was completed as part of a practical assignment. The subject can be found in the "Doc" folder. It was developed solely by Matth√©o Valcke. An SQL file named "init.sql" is provided in the "mysql" folder to set up a database with test data.

Local Project Setup:
To set up the project locally, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

composer install
Then, open your DATABASE manager (e.g., MySQL) and create a database named "gift". Configure the .env file with your database settings:

DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:3306/gift"
Next, execute the following command in the terminal to migrate tables to your database:

php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
Finally, start the server by running:

symfony server:start --port=8000
The microservice will be running on port 127.0.0.1:8000.

Project Initialization with Docker:
To access the project with Docker, simply switch to the "Docker" branch of the project. I attempted to set up Docker for this project, but encountered issues with the database connectivity. Here are the details:

I set up a docker-compose with a symfony service and a mysql service.
A Dockerfile was created for the symfony service.
Unfortunately, i have unable to resolve a database connection error from the project (see the .env file). Therefore, i decided not to implement Docker on the main branch. To run the project with Docker, use the following command:

docker-compose up -d --build
